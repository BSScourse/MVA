## BSS course
*Materials for the MVA cours "Methods for source separation, with application to Astrophysics"*

----
###**Courses :**

The courses are organized as follows (**the slides are available in the "slides" folder**):

Course #1 : Introduction, unsupervised source separation, statistical principles

Course #2 : Advanced Independent Component Analysis

Course #3 : Unsupervised source separation, the sparse way

Course #4 : Optimisation and proximal algorithms for source separation-take I

Course #5 : Optimisation and proximal algorithms for source separation-take II

Course #6 : Plug & play methods, applications to astrophysics

Course #7 : Non-Negative Matrix Factorisation, theory and practice

Course #8 : Advanced NMF, from linear to non-linear models


----

### **Practical work :**

We strongly advise the use of Python for these practical works.

Usually, part of the practical works are done during the course; we strongly advise to bring your laptop with you !

Participants that opt for Python will find the following modules helpful:

    –ipython
    –scipy/numpy
    –matplotlib
    –scikit-learn
    -torch
    –pyfits

Most of them can be set up with easily using standard porting tools (apt-get, macport … etc).

The practical will be organized as follows (**the slides are available in the "practical_work" folder**):

PW #1 :Unsupervised source separation, from ICA to GMCA

Report expected for **TBD** – necessary material:
PW #2 : Optimisation and proximal algorithms for source separation

Report expected for TBD – necessary material:
PW #3 : Non-negative source separation

Report expected for TBD – necessary material:

### **Project :**

The project will focus on "Component separation in X-ray astrophysics", the necessary material will be made available in the **project** folder.
